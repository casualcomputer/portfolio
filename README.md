## Talks
I presented to a wide variety of audience, including analysts, managers, directors, director generals, and C-suite executives in public serivce from Canada and the United States. Below are a sample of data talks I gave:

- **CRA Lunch and Learn**
  - Summarization of High-dimensional Tables on database servers ([GitHub](https://github.com/casualcomputer/sql.mechanic))
  - Summarization of High-dimensional Tables on database servers, with RShiny Interface ([GitHub](https://github.com/casualcomputer/table-summarizer))
  - Create Organizational Maps and Search Tools with Webscraping and Semantic Search
- **GC Data Lunch and Learn**
  - Making Your Tables Pretty with Reactable
- **Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)**
  - Create Webpage Maps to Visualize and Measure User Experience Digital Journey ([GitHub](https://github.com/casualcomputer/social-network-analysis))
- **Public Service Data Challenge (First Place Team Winner)** [News](https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/agricultural-advice-ai-wins-canadas-public-service-data-challenge/)
  - AgSearch (precursor to AgGPT) - An agriculture search engine using a hybrid search strategy to answer long questions and increase search relevance
  - AgGPT - An AI Chat Assistant to Help Farmers and Agri-businesses Find Resources
- **Evaluation GenAI Committee** 
  - Create Organizational Maps with Text Analytics, and Deploy Local Language Models for Program Evaluations

## Projects
- **Backtesting Software in R:** Developed a robust backtesting tool in R to evaluate the historical performance of various technical trading strategies and company fundamentals (stocks and options).
- **Python Real Estate Simulator:** Created a comprehensive real estate simulation tool in Python to pinpoint investment opportunities. The tool conducts neighborhood analysis, and performs computer appraisals (sales comparison and income approach). It also includes a payment simulation feature that forecasts cash flow changes due to interest rate fluctuations.
- **LLM for program evaluation:** Developing a RAG-based local LLM optimized on program evaluation tasks. ([Streamlit App](https://github.com/casualcomputer/evaluation-ai-pro))

## Small Apps & Random things
- **What is my CMA for Canada Carbon Rebate (CCR)?** Find your Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) by typing your address or postal code. [App](https://creative-analytics.shinyapps.io/CMA_finder/)
- **How good was Charlie 2.0?** How good was the CRA chatbot at answering the CRA FAQ's? Find out on this [Github](https://github.com/casualcomputer/tax_chatbots).
- **How effective is government outreach?** I use geospatial analysis and census data to improve the understanding of social and economic dynamics for government policies. This provides a practical guide on Gender-Based Analysis Plus (GBA+) to evaluate the impact on vulnerable populations.
